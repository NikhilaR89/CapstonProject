## Project Aim:
We are building a Password Generator using Python with a Streamlit interface to showcase backend functionality. The app helps users create strong, customizable passwords for better online security.
## Problem Statement:
This project addresses the challenge users face in creating secure passwords that meet security requirements like length and character diversity (digits, special characters, uppercase letters). Many rely on weak or common passwords, increasing their risk of being hacked.
## Objectives:
##### 1.Simplify Password Creation: Provide a user-friendly tool that generates secure passwords based on preferences.
##### 2.Enhance Security: Promote strong passwords by offering options for character variety and enforcing secure length standards.
##### 3.Immediate Feedback: Allow users to quickly generate and view passwords for convenience.
##### 4.Raise Awareness: Educate users on the importance of strong passwords through an intuitive interface.
This project aims to make password generation easy and efficient, contributing to improved online security practices.
## Core Features:
##### 1.Basic Password Generation: Generate random passwords using a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
##### 2.Fixed-Length Passwords: Offer options for generating passwords of fixed lengths, such as 8 or 12 characters, for simplicity.
##### 3.Character Type Selection: Allow users to choose whether to include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., !, @, #).
##### 4.Streamlit Interface: Create a simple web interface using Streamlit, where users can click a button to generate and display passwords.
##### 5.Instant Password Generation: A button for instant password creation based on user preferences.
##### 6.Error Handling: Display the generated password directly within the Streamlit interface, keeping the process straightforward.
## Basic Features:
These are the essential functionalities that will serve as the foundation of your application:
##### 1.Password Creation: Users can generate new passwords by specifying the desired length and selecting character types such as letters, numbers, and special characters.
##### 2.Password Customization: Users can customize password creation by choosing to include or exclude specific character types (e.g., only letters and numbers, or with special characters).
##### 3.Password Viewing: Generated passwords are displayed immediately on the screen, with an option to copy them to the clipboard.
##### 4.Password Strength Indicator: A basic strength indicator provides feedback on whether the generated password is weak, moderate, or strong based on the selected options.
## Technologies and Tools
### Programming Language:
##### Python: The primary language for developing the application, chosen for its simplicity and extensive library support.
### Libraries:
##### Streamlit: For building the web application interface, allowing for rapid development of interactive user interfaces.
##### Random: For generating random sequences of characters to create secure passwords.
##### String: For accessing predefined sets of characters, such as digits, punctuation, and letters.
### Development Tools:
##### Visual Studio Code (VS Code): As the primary code editor for writing and debugging the code.
